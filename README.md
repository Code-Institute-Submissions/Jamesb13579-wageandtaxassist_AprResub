# Project Three: Wage and Tax assist

I created program to be to enable the user to accurately and easily work out employees taxes.

The aim for the game is to build a program that allows the user to save employee data. Then each week be able to easily input hours worked and get back employee wage and tax amounts.

## User Stories
__As a new user__

- I would be like to be able to easily navigate the program.
- I would like to be able use the program intuitively.

__As an existing user__

- I would like to be able to access employee details to be able to work out wages.

## How to use

I wanted this app to be easy for the user to use. so i tried to build it in a way that made sense. 

There are four sections at the start:

- [New Employee](#new-employee)
- [Employee Wages](#employee-wages)
- [List names](#list-names)
- [Exit](#exit)

## New Employee

To get to this section you choose option one, this section will then allow you to input and save three pieces of data to the spreadsheet. It will ask for Employee name, Employee yearly tax credits and Employee hourly wage rate. You will then be given the option to start again or exit.

## Employee Wages

To get to this section you choose option two, this section allows you to work out a current employees wages and tax details. It will ask you for the Employee name and hours worked this week.
It will then check the name against the spread sheet and return the correct wages and taxes. You will then be given the option to start again or exit.
